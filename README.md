ilastik-py3win
==============

This repository contains conda recipes for the dependencies of ilastik for Windows with Python 3.5.
The ilastik project can be found on its [homepage](ilastik.org) or on [github](https://github.com/ilastik).

Most dependencies are already provided by Anaconda and conda-forge. However, for some there exist no recipe or no windows binaries at the time of writing.
For these, the recipes in this repository can be used.

These recipes are built using the [conda-build](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/build.html) tool.
Though they have been forked from recipes specifically developed for Unix and/or Mac, the modifications have only been tested on Windows systems.
